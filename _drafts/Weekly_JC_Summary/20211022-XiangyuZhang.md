Animal use a precisely timed motor sequence to behave, including predation, escape and swimming. 
All behaviors need to cooperate with each other to make the behavior happen smoothly.
In this article, the author found that escape behavior occurs by the combination of turning and swimming, 
in which escape behavior makes zebrafish turn, and swimming behavior makes zebrafish stay away from predators.
When zebrafish is stimulated by external sound, auditory bone vibration activates M cells in zebrafish brain, 
which leads to zebrafish steering behavior, and activates CRN neurons downstream of M cells. 
CRN neurons have feedback inhibition effect on M cells and transmit signals to downstream nMLF neurons, 
which leads to swimming behavior and keeps zebrafish away from danger. 
If CRN neurons were ablated, zebrafish had only steering behavior and no swimming behavior. 
It can be seen that CRN neurons are relay stations that coordinate the two behaviors of turning and 
swimming in the process of escape.
