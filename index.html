    <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h4><b>Mission Statement</b></h4>
  <p>How intelligence and behavior emerge from complex and intricate interactions within the brain remain important and unsolved mysteries in modern science. This is an exciting time. In the last decade, we have seen rapid progress in experimental tools that now make it possible to monitor and manipulate brain circuits in unprecedented detail. This is also a confusing time. Neuroscientists are lost in the jungles of brain structures and dynamics. Mathematical theory is now pivotal to bring new insights, guide experiments, and identify unifying concepts and principles of brain function. Following rapid progress and development in neurotechnologies and trend in modern brain theory, we will explore the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and function; introduce experimental tools that allow us to monitor and manipulate nervous system at unprecedented detail; as well as theoretical ideas that identify unifying concepts and candidate principles. We will focus on certain kind of questions that are favored from a physicist standard point of view. Special topics may include efficient representation of information in early sensory system, wiring optimization in neural circuit, dynamics in recurrent neural networks, fine tuning and homeostasis, memory, as well as noise and chaos in neuronal systems.</p>
