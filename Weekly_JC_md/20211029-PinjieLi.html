    <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
  <p>As for the neural correlates of decision making, studies recording many brain areas in parallel has sprung up since 2010. 
    That subsequent motor execution-related signals have a widespread effect on neural activities is also well demonstrated. 
    However, the bridge process between sensory inputs and motor outputs, 
    in another words, the pre-decision making process is poorly understood. 
    Here, the authors design an elaborate behavior paradigm in mice and use wide-field imaging, 
    two-photon microscopy as well as Gaussian Process Models and ridge regression to imply that 
    secondary motor cortex should play an important role.
