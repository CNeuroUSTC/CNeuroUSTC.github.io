We could extract different aspects of information from the same object for different purpose, especially when making decisions. How is this cognitive flexibility implemented in brain? This paper approaches this big question by investigating how medial frontal cortex (MFC) selectively represents current task-related information and particularly, how MFC even retrieves the current task-related memory from hippocampus and amygdala (HA).

More specifically, this paper focuses on two tasks: patients are instructed to make binary (yes/no) decision based on the same image but for different purpose: “is this image a fruit?” (categorization task) or “have you seen this image before?” (memory task). The recorded single-unit spiking activity is used to decode **five variables: task type (categorization/memory), response modality(button press/saccade), category(human face/monkey face/fruit/..), memory(new/old), choice(yes/no)** to quantify the strength of representation of these behavior variables in MFC and HA, and importantly, the cross-decoding of the other four variables between two different task types to measure how the same behavioral variable is distinctively encoded to fullfill `printf()` current task needs in a geometrical view.

```python
def bubble_sort(list)
  return list if list.size <= 1 # already sorted
  swapped = true
  while swapped do
    swapped = false
    0.upto(list.size-2) do |i|
      if list[i] > list[i+1]
        list[i], list[i+1] = list[i+1], list[i] # swap values
        swapped = true
      end
    end
  end

  list
end
```
