title: A distributional code for value in dopaminebased reinforcement learning
---

This paper shows that dopamine signal in ventral tagmental area is not uniform ,but rather every dopamine neuron learns a different value for RPE (reward prediction error) calculation.these values together constitutes the reward distribution,which can be much more useful than learning just a single value.
