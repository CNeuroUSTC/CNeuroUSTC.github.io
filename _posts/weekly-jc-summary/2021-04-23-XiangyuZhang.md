title: Larval Zebrafish Use Olfactory Detection of Sodium and Chloride to Avoid Salt Water
---

Report Summary:
Land animals can use epithelial sodium channels to detect salinity, but zebrafish lack this kind of channels. So they may have other ways to protect them from high salinity environment. In this article, they confirm that zebrafish can response to increasing salt concentration with a 20° to 40° turn. With the help of calcium imaging techniques, they find that this kind of response is controlled by a small subset of olfactory neurons, but not lateral line. Ablating these olfactory neurons will eliminate the response to NaCl. And the underlying mechanism of these kind of neurons detecting salinity is that they are sensitive to both cation and anion, especially Na+ and Cl-.
